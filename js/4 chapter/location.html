    <p>The location object in JavaScript represents the current URL of the web page. It has several properties and methods. Here are two properties and two methods of the location object: <br><br>

        Properties: <br><br>
        location.pathname: <br> This property returns the path and filename of the current URL as a string. For example, if the URL is "https://www.example.com/products/item.html," location.pathname would be "/products/item.html."
        
        location.href: <br>This property provides the full URL of the current page, including the protocol (e.g., "https://"), domain, path, query parameters, and hash.
        
        location.hostname: <br> It returns the hostname of the web server from the URL, such as "example.com" in "https://www.example.com/index.html."
        <br><br><br>
        Methods: <br>
        location.replace(url): <br>This method replaces the current URL with the URL specified by the url parameter. It is similar to assign, but it does not create a new entry in the browser's history, making it useful for redirecting the user to a different page without leaving a history trail.

        location.reload(): <br>This method reloads the current web page. You can call it without any arguments to reload the page from the cache or pass true as an argument to force a full reload from the server.
        
        location.assign(url): <br> This method loads a new web page specified by the URL provided as an argument. It navigates the browser to the new URL, similar to clicking on a link.</p>
    <script>// Accessing properties
    const currentURL = location.href;
    const serverHostname = location.hostname;
    console.log(serverHostname);
    console.log(currentURL);
    // Using methods
    location.reload(); // Reloads the current page
    // location.assign("https://www.google.com"); // Navigates to a new page
    </script>
</body>
